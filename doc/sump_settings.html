<h1 align=center>logic_sniffer.py<br />SUMP Settings</h1>

<p>Specific settings for the SUMP device are controlled from the Device Settings dialog:
</p><p align="center">
<img src="Screenshot-SUMP_Device_Settings-3.png" width="90%" />
</p><p>
The various fields are:
<h3>Connection Settings</h3>
<dl>
  <dt class="menu">Timeout<dd>The timeout limit (in seconds) applied on a read or write with the SUMP device.
  A blank entry means no timeout is applied.
</dl>


<h3>Analyzer Settings</h3>
<dl>
    <dt class="menu">Sampling Clock
    <dd>Selects the source of the clock:
        <dl>
        <dt class="menu">Internal<dd>uses the clock generated internally by the SUMP device.
        <dt class="menu">External Rising<dd>uses a clock signal connected to the CKI pin, clocking on the rising edge.
        <dt class="menu">External Falling<dd>uses a clock signal connected to the CKI pin, clocking on the falling edge.
        </dl>
    <dt class="menu">Sampling Rate<dd>selects a rate for the internal clock to generate.
    <dt class="menu">Recording Size<dd>selects the number of samples to record.
    <dt class="menu">Channel Group<dd>causes the checked channel groups to be recorded.
    <!--
    <dt class="menu">Filter<dd>enables internal noise filtering when checked.
    <dt class="menu">Demux<dd>enables double-speed recording when checked.
    -->
    <dt class="menu">Pre-Processing<dd>enables one of the mutually exclusive signal processing options:
          <dl>
	<dt class="menu">None<dd>one sample is read in every clock cycle
	<dt class="menu">Filter<dd>very short input pulses are ignored, reading one sample per clock cycle
	<dt class="menu">Demux<dd>two samples are read in every clock cycle
	</dl>
    <dt class="menu">RLE<dd>enables Run-Length-Encoded data transmission when checked.
    <dt class="menu">Latest-first<dd>check when the SUMP device sends its most recent samples first (e.g. Open Bench Logic Sniffer.)
    When not checked the samples received first are assumed to be the earliest.
</dl>


<h3>Trigger Settings</h3>
<dl>
    <dt class="menu">Enable
    <dd><dl>
        <dt class="menu">None<dd>recording begins as soon as "capture" is clicked.
        <dt class="menu">Simple<dd>Starts recording based on a single trigger signal configured in "Stage 0".
        <dt class="menu">Complex<dd>Starts recording based on a combination of triggers in Stages 0..3 .
    </dl>
    <dt class="menu">Pre/Post Ratio<dd>ratio of samples that will be recorded before and after the trigger firing.
    <dt class="menu">Stage 0 .. 3<dd>These trigger stages can be combined in various ways 
        <dl>
            <dt class="menu">Arm<dd><dl>
	       <dt class="menu">Immediately<dd>the stage is armed and begins testing inputs as soon as the sampling run starts.
	       <dt class="menu">Level 1 .. 3<dd>the stage will be armed after the specified trigger Level is set by another stage.
	       </dl>
	 <dt class="menu">Mode<dd><dl>
	     <dt class="menu">Parallel<dd>the associated Trigger Mask and Trigger Values are tested in parallel against the respective input channels.
	     <dt class="menu">Serial<dd>the associated Trigger Mask and Trigger Values are tested against successive values from one of the input channels.
               </dl>
	 <dt class="menu">Channel<dd>specifies the input channel to use for Serial trigger mode.  A channel number from 0 to 31 may be specified.
	 <dt class="menu">Mask<dd>check the channels (in parallel mode) or successive samples (in serial mode) to be tested by this trigger.
	 <dt class="menu">Value<dd>checked channels (in parallel mode) or successive samples (in serial mode) must be read as 1 for the trigger to fire.  Un-checked values must read as 0.
	 <dt class="menu">Action<dd><dl>specifies the action to take when this trigger fires:
	     <dt class="menu">Capture<dd>begin recording.
	     <dt class="menu">Next Level<dd>advance the trigger level by one to arm another stage.
	     </dl>
	 <dt class="menu">Delay<dd>delays a given number of clock cycles between the trigger firing and the specified Action.  
	 From 0 to 65,535 samples may be specified.
	 For convenience this delay can be entered as a sample count, or a time in seconds.
    </dl>
</dl>

<h3>Control Buttons</h3>
<dl>
    <dt class="menu">Capture<dd>arms trigger stages and begins a recording run.
    <dt class="menu">OK<dd>accepts the SUMP configuration to be used in a later recording run.
    <dt class="menu">Cancel<dd>throws away the values entered with no further action.
</dl>
